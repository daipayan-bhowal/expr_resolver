Expression Resolver(Expression evaluation using Priority Linked List)
 
 For now register storage/temporary variable has been commented out

It solves the expression "a+b-c*c-d"

 For a=9, b=3, c=2 and d=1 so expression becomes as below:-
9+3-2*2-1

Each linked list node which contains operator/operand will contain a priority field
based on priority field we will apply BODMAS rule for calculation

Final answer is:-
9+3-2*2-1 = 7
